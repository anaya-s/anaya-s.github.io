        <h1>Neural Networking Notes</h1>
        AI covers three main areas:
        Artificial learning (AI) is a large topic that covers anything related to making computers smarter.
        Machine Learning(ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on things that can self-learn without being pre-programmed by a human. e.g. statistical methods, brain-inspired neural networks

        Not all smart systems have the ability to learn (AI without ML). These are called GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence).


        Neural Computing (NC) is a subset of machine learning itself and refers to specifically brain-inspired ML methods that use neural networks to learn.
